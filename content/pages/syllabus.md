Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Summary Description
-------------------

### Digital Anthropology

Digital Anthropology is a Spring 2003 applied social science and media arts seminar surveying the blossoming arena of digital-artifact enabled experimental sociology/anthropology. We will emphasize both (a) **Technology Testbeds** – systematically deploying research lab prototypes and corporate pre-production products in a sample human organizational population and carefully observing the social consequences, and (b) **Sociometrics** – using digital artifacts to better observe and measure the complex social reality of interesting human systems.

### Technology Testbeds

Technology Testbeds result when multiple labs at MIT and a variety of corporate sponsors showcase their advanced prototypes and pre-production models – at MIT Sloan, MIT-generally, in our surrounding Kendall community, and even at sponsor homesites – while we closely track their social impact, observe real usage patterns over time, and systematically assess future market potential.

### Sociometrics

Sociometrics are the data and corresponding statistical analysis of social phenomena. Such metrics result from the systematic deployment of – and observation via – minimally intrusive digital artifacts which capture relevant and complex social interaction data over time.

### The Zauri Initiative

Registered students in the seminar will receive a Zaurus mobile Linux® PDA for the duration of the semester. This will be our common platform for application development and trial experiments.

Expected Student Deliverables
-----------------------------

All students are expected to:

1.  participate in the exploratory phase of the Reality Mining project,
2.  form teams to build novel experimental tools/artifacts and/or applications,
3.  run at least one rigorous experiment, and
4.  write a summary project report.

We hope this class effort will be the basis for future research and/or publications.

Credits
-------

9 (2-4-3)

Target Student Population
-------------------------

We expect between 10 and 20 MAS, EE, and Sloan students. Registration will be limited by hardware and resource availability.

Interwoven Themes
-----------------

Woven throughout the semester are a series of critical strategic themes and threads, including, broadly:

*   Predictive Microcosms
*   Fast Iteration
*   Experimental Sociology
*   Comparative Market Research
*   Cross-Campus Connections
